## 🔧 System Implementations

### **1️⃣ Hardware-Based Implementation**
- Radar sensor measures real-time object distance  
- Sender ESP32 encrypts data using AES algorithm  
- Data is transmitted wirelessly over UDP  
- Receiver ESP32 decrypts data  
- System calculates:
  - Minimum, maximum, and average distance  
  - Nearest object direction  
  - Velocity of detected objects  
- Results are displayed on an external LCD module  

➡ Demonstrates secure **embedded communication**, on-chip AES encryption, and standalone real-time processing without internet dependency.

### **2️⃣ Cloud-Based Implementation**
- Radar data is transmitted to a cloud analytics environment  
- Data is stored and processed for extended analysis  
- Cloud platform calculates and visualizes:  
  - **Distance between detected objects**  
  - Motion trend analysis  
  - Log-based comparison over time  
- Cloud dashboard can be accessed remotely for monitoring and visualization  

➡ Enables **remote monitoring, scalability, analytics, and persistent storage** beyond hardware-only limitations.
